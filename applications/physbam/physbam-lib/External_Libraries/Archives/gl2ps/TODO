* Add a special font name ("Data"? Or "RawPS", "RawPDF", "RawTEX"?)
  and modify the PrintPrimitive routines to just write the string
  directly to the stream

------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Think about a way to provide a (even rough) progress indicator
  through a callback...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Apple's Preview.app doesn't support '/ShadingType 4'... Should we
  submit a bug report to Apple?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Enhance the polygon/line/point offset stuff

------------------------------------------------------------------------

* SVG output...

From Lassi A. Tuura" <lassi.tuura@cern.ch>:

SVG can also be produced from PS, search google for ps2svg.ps; works
fine for the files I produced with gl2ps.  SVG is easy to produce in
itself and similar to postscript; see http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG.
Here's an abbreviated sample from a cube printed with gl2ps and
coverted with ps2svg (M = moveto, L = lineto):
<svg width="100%" viewBox="0 0 594 840" stroke="rgb(0,0,0)" fill="none">
<g stroke-miterlimit="10">
 <g transform="matrix(1,0,0,-1,0,840)">
   <path stroke="none" fill="rgb(65,10,10)"
     d="M256.018,103.084L238.296,230.246L182.367,162.194Z"/>
   <path stroke="none" fill="rgb(65,10,10)"
     d="M256.018,103.084L182.367,162.194L187.264,56.048Z"/>
   <path stroke="none" fill="rgb(10,10,10)"
     d="M187.264,56.048L182.367,162.194L74.7287,183.309Z"/>

* Escape special characters?

Now that you mention it I could see where some may want to do this.

I have not used your LaTeX ouput option so I am not sure how this would 
effect it.
